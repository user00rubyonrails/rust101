[Chrono change to v0.4.30 breaks the build of actix-http-1.0.1 #3135]
For reference this is what I had to do to specify the exact version before the breaking changes.
chrono = { version = "= 0.4.29" }


a future is an unprocessed computation, where the result is
not yet available, but when we call or wait, the future will be populated with the result of
the computation. 
- Futures can also be referred to as promises, delays, or deferred
- have a `join` function, it makes sense to utilize this to split the time taken in half by getting two futures to run at the same time
The futures are being run sequentially. The only difference is that we return the result of
the futures in a tuple.
However, this does not give us the result that we were expecting:
The futures are being run sequentially. The only difference is that we return the result of
the futures in a tuple. Despite the futures::join function being counter-intuitive
